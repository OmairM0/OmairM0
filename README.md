# Omair Mohammed

Front-End Developer specializing in building clean, modern, and scalable web applications.

I have hands-on experience delivering responsive user interfaces, translating designs into high-quality implementations, and integrating applications with backend services. I focus on writing maintainable code, creating reusable components, and building user experiences that are both efficient and intuitive.

I have worked on real-world projects ranging from management systems and landing pages to community platforms and personal productivity applications. I am comfortable working independently as well as collaborating within teams to deliver reliable and well-structured solutions.

I am continuously learning, improving my skills, and looking for opportunities to contribute to meaningful projects as a front-end engineer.
